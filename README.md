This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Email Contact Form Setup

The portfolio includes a contact form that sends emails directly to your inbox using EmailJS. Here's how to set it up:

1. Create a free account at [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/)
2. Create a new service in the EmailJS dashboard (use Gmail, Outlook, or other email providers)
3. Create a new email template with the following template variables:
   - `from_name` - Sender's email address
   - `subject` - Email subject
   - `message` - Email message content
   - `reply_to` - Reply-to email address
4. Get your EmailJS public key from the dashboard
5. Update the following environment variables in `.env.local`:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_service_id
   NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your_template_id
   NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
   ```

EmailJS will now handle sending emails from your portfolio's contact form directly to your inbox.
